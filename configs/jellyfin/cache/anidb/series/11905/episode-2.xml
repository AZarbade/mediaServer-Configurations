<summary>The secret of Tanya`s birth is revealed. Tanya was a cold and unemotional Japanese salaryman who was pushed in front of a train by a man he laid off.  An infuriated godlike creature named "Being X" sent him to this world, and reincarnated him as a baby girl... with no promise that he would ever be reincarnated again.  Now Tanya has to survive, because this is all she`s got!
