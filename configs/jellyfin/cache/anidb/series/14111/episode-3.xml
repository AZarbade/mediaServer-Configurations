<summary>When Fujiwara glances at an unwholesome magazine confiscated by the headmaster, she notices to her dismay a survey with the question, "When was your `first time`?" The magazine claims 34% of high school students have had that experience. Fujiwara calms a startled Shirogane by doubting the veracity of the figure, believing it to be too high, while Kaguya posits, "This percentage seems about right to me," and freely admits that she has had that experience.  Shirogane, who has never been in a romantic situation, is shocked by Kaguya’s admission, but when she sees his reaction, she uses it as an opportunity to stir him up by asking, "Don`t you have a girlfriend?"
