<summary>When Kaguya stays home from school with a cold, Shirogane tells the other council members that he`s going to drop off handouts at her house, an announcement that stirs Fujiwara up as she volunteers to go in his stead. According to Fujiwara, Kaguya acts like a baby when she gets a cold. Shirogane`s heart beats fast as he imagines a cute Kaguya who`s upfront about what she wants, but he shoots down the idea of all the student council members barging in on Kaguya when she`s sick. So, Fujiwara proposes playing a game of Concentration to decide on who will visit Kaguya. Even Ishigami gets dragged into what becomes a serious battle!
