<summary>Tanaka will spare no effort to have a lazy day.  He visits a temple before school to pray for a peaceful day, but Miyano, a girl from his class, asks him to make her his apprentice. 
Miyano explains she wants to be a listless mature woman, but not wanting any new friends, Tanaka declines. However, Miyano doesn`t relent and Tanaka eventually accepts if it`s only for a day. Miyano begins observing Tanaka and attempts to mimic his listlessness.
