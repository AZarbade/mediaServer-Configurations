<summary>For the first time, Ohta is absent. Tanaka needs to deliver a worksheet to Ohta, but he doesn`t remember Ohta`s place because he`s always carried there. Being yelled by Echizen that he should know more about Ohta, Tanaka and Echizen head to Ohta`s house together.
Ohta comes to school the next day, but he has a sprained ankle that will take a week to heal. While the classmates wonder who will be taking care of Tanaka, Tanaka claims he will be taking care of Ohta.
