we used to go to this--

on Knickerbocker and Greene.

[both chuckle]

1059
00:56:53,552 --> 00:56:55,750
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

1060
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:57,785
He used to always say,

1061
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,448
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

1062

life will show you
everything you need to know."

1063
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,598
So that's why you said yes
to all of this.

1064
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,096
I figured if
he is somewhere watching,

1065
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:15,770
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

1066
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,509
would definitely
make him proud.

this key thing's in Peru?

1068

I-- I think so.

Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

at my museum.

1204
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:20,347
They're new.

1205
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:22,712
They're not
on the Transwarp Key.

1206
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:24,384
There's two of them.

1207
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,487
[rubble thudding]

1208
01:06:33,362 --> 01:06:34,526
[whispering] Mirage?

1209
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,566
Let's keep moving.
Just give me a second.

1210
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,341
Run!
[screams]

1211
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,046
[whimpers]

1212
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,676
[both shouting]

1213
01:06:52,711 --> 01:06:54,810
[grunts]
[chittering]

1214
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,614
Go, go, go, go, go!

1215
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,781
Mirage! We got trouble!

1216
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:01,718
<i> One of those things</i>
<i> is down here!</i>
<i> Where are you guys?</i>

1217
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:03,786
[Mirage] Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

1218
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:04,952
[tires screech]

1219
01:07:06,362 --> 01:07:07,889
[Scourge]
<i> The Autobots are moving.</i>

1220
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:10,265
They must have found the key.

1221
01:07:14,832 --> 01:07:16,271
[Elena shouts, grunts]

1222
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:18,735
[chittering]
[shouts]

1223
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:20,110
[grunting]

1224
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:22,937
Come on!

1225
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:26,072
Airazor, where are the humans?

1226
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:28,877
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

1227
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,253
[engine accelerates]

1228
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:41,087
[roars]

1229
01:07:41,122 --> 01:07:43,298
[mechanical whirring]

1230
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:44,629
[tires screech]

1231
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:48,468
[Mirage] Aw, man,
they're tailing us!

1232
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,571
[breathing heavily]

1233
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:55,409
[chittering]

1234
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:00,315
Do something!
What do you want me to do?

1235
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:01,745
[snarls]
[glove fires]

1236
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,352
[Elena yelps]
[grunts]

1237
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:06,013
[powers down]

1238
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:09,951
You had a gun
this whole time?

1239
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:12,019
[engine revving]

1240
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,761
[engine accelerating]
[tires screeching]

1241
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:25,175
[mechanical whirring]

1242
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:30,312
[Mirage]
<i> Prime, what the hell</i>
<i> are you doing?</i>

1243
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:33,139
I'm going to take back
Scourge's key

1244
01:08:33,174 --> 01:08:36,483
and then take off his head.

1245
01:08:36,518 --> 01:08:38,353
[Scourge growling]

1246
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:50,926
[Mirage] Guys! [shouts]
I could use a little help!

1247
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,027
Did someone call
for backup?

1248
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:03,004
Brake, brake, brake!
[Wheeljack] What?

1249
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,314
Brake!

1250
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:08,383
[no audible dialogue]

1251
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:12,684
[tires screech]

1252
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,390
Yay! [laughing]

1253
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:18,591
[Prime] This is for Bee!

1254
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:32,198
[Battletrap] Come here.

1255
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:33,540
[tires screech]
Hold on!

1256
01:09:34,576 --> 01:09:36,411
[Arcee grunting]

1257
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,451
[mechanical whirring]

1258
01:09:49,756 --> 01:09:50,821
[Prime groans]

1259
01:09:50,856 --> 01:09:53,593
[grunting]

1260
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:56,365
I love your fire, Prime.

1261
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,193
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

1262
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:04,065
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

1263
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,375
[both grunting]

1264
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,204
[screeches]
[blades clank]

1265
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:14,251
[mechanical whirring]

1266
01:10:21,623 --> 01:10:23,557
[mechanical whirring]

1267
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:29,827
[screeches]

1268
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:34,370
I will end you, Scourge.

1269
01:10:34,405 --> 01:10:36,064
[growls]

1270
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:39,738
That is a promise.

1271
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:41,377
[Nightbird]
They're getting away.

1272
01:10:41,412 --> 01:10:43,170
Not this time.

1273
01:10:45,306 --> 01:10:46,580
[Airazor screeches]

1274
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,421
[water burbling]
I hear water.

1275
01:10:56,427 --> 01:10:57,822
Where are we?

1276
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:02,123
[roaring, grunting]

1277
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:05,126
What was that?

1278
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,469
[roaring, grunting continues]

1279
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:16,709
[Elena shouts]

1280
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:19,272
[roars]

1281
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,307
Who are you?

1282
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:23,177
And why are you hunting
for the key?

1283
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,652
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

1284
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:28,556
Uh, Mirage?
Don't worry.
Your boy's got this.

1285
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:31,119
[roars]
[Mirage squeals]

1286
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,693
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

1287
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,366
[Wheeljack] Hey, hey, hey!

1288
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:37,433
Not so fa--

1289
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,964
[roars]

1290
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,098
Ay, ay, ay.

1291
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,705
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

1292
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,709
Stand down!
[mechanical whirring]

1293
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:51,546
[roars]

1294
01:11:51,581 --> 01:11:54,681
I won't ask a second time.

1295
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:57,354
[grunts]

1296
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,490
No! All of you, stop!

1297
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,759
Airazor.
Primal.

1298
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:09,828
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

1299
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:13,095
The others... Are they...

1300
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,702
I am all that is left.

1301
01:12:17,035 --> 01:12:19,167
[exhales deeply]

1302
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:22,577
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

1303
01:12:22,612 --> 01:12:25,008
Rhinox.
[snorts]

1304
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:26,614
[Airazor] Cheetor.

1305
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:28,374
Sorry about scaring you,
brother.

1306
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:30,420
[Mirage] Scared?
[scoffs] Please.

1307
01:12:30,455 --> 01:12:31,982
I'm not scared.
[liquid drips]

1308
01:12:32,017 --> 01:12:33,555
That's just engine oil.
[chuckles]

1309
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:38,054
[Airazor] And our leader,
Optimus Primal.

1310
01:12:38,925 --> 01:12:40,958
Optimus Primal?

1311
01:12:40,993 --> 01:12:45,259
Named after you,
the legendary warrior
of Cybertron.

1312
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,469
It's an honor.

1313
01:12:47,934 --> 01:12:51,067
Airazor,
I'm happy to see you,
old friend.

1314
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:54,235
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

1315
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,776
I fear you bring dark tidings.

1316
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:59,075
Scourge has come to Earth.

1317
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,912
He's found us.

1318
01:13:00,947 --> 01:13:03,409
And he has half of the key.

1319
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:06,214
We must find
the second piece
before he does.

1320
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,117
But it wasn't
in the cave.

1321
01:13:08,152 --> 01:13:11,186
It was.
But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe.

1322
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,496
Where is it now?

1323
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:18,127
Come with me.

1324
01:13:26,434 --> 01:13:28,368
[Elena]
That doesn't look so good.

1325
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:31,712
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

1326
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:34,550
But I'll be all right.

1327
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,454
[screeches]

1328
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:49,499
[Noah] Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

1329
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:51,666
Yeah. Your little bro's
got this thing

1330
01:13:51,701 --> 01:13:54,460
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

1331
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:56,264
Wait, you been talking
to Kris?
Uh-huh.

1332
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:59,740
[machine beeping]
He gave me this
to keep tabs on you,

1333
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:01,236
make sure I'm keeping
my promise.

1334
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:02,809
Oh, here.

1335
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:04,943
Next time,
include warning labels.

1336
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:07,880
[Mirage]
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

1337
01:14:07,915 --> 01:14:09,981
I guess it does
look better on me.

1338
01:14:10,016 --> 01:14:12,621
Just don't ask
what part of my body
it came from.

1339
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,688
[chuckles]

1340
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,659
So, who are you?

1341
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:19,793
[Primal] We Maximals
are an advanced race

1342
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:24,061
dedicated to
the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

1343
01:14:24,096 --> 01:14:27,394
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

1344
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:31,134
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal--

1345
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:32,839
That was you guys,
right?

1346
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:34,236
[chuckles] Not us.

1347
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:36,777
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

1348
01:14:36,812 --> 01:14:40,275
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

1349
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,816
When Unicron destroyed
our world,

1350
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:46,655
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

1351
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,690
no matter the cost.

1352
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:50,989
And Earth
has been a safe refuge.

1353
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,774
[growling]

1354
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:08,875
[laughing]

1355
01:15:19,855 --> 01:15:23,923
[speaking
Peruvian language]

1356
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:25,595
[speaks
Peruvian language]

1357
01:15:28,094 --> 01:15:30,259
[speaks
Peruvian language]

1358
01:15:30,294 --> 01:15:32,602
[Primal] This is Amaru.

1359
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,737
He and his family
are the last descendants
of a tribe

1360
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:38,641
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

1361
01:15:38,676 --> 01:15:43,679
When we arrived,
they shared their world
with us.

1362
01:15:43,714 --> 01:15:46,143
And together
we protected its people

1363
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:48,948
and our secret.

1364
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,451
You allied with humans.

1365
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,058
[Primal] We did.

1366
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,831
[Prime]
If you give us this key,

1367
01:16:03,866 --> 01:16:08,000
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

1368
01:16:08,035 --> 01:16:12,499
The Maximals have
already sacrificed one home
to protect the universe.

1369
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,908
I won't risk losing another.

1370
01:16:14,943 --> 01:16:17,614
As a leader,
I know you understand.

1371
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:21,783
[electrical humming]

1372
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:46,401
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

1373
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:49,404
Well, he has lost so much.

1374
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,406
Many more will perish

1375
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,574
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

1376
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:58,380
If you had another chance
to save our home,

1377
01:16:58,415 --> 01:17:00,184
would you act any differently?

1378
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:04,353
[growls quietly]

1379
01:17:04,388 --> 01:17:07,587
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

1380
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:10,458
[growling]

1381
01:17:12,429 --> 01:17:14,671
[Primal] Your friend
will find peace here.

1382
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,104
This is raw Energon.

1383
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:21,139
[Primal]
The valley is rich with it.

1384
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:23,636
Could this revive Bee?

1385
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:27,112
I'm sorry,
but in this state,
it is inert.

1386
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,785
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

1387
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,722
Greater than anything
we have here.

1388
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:35,285
[speaking Peruvian language]

1389
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,420
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1390
01:17:38,455 --> 01:17:40,356
Yes, I am.

1391
01:17:40,391 --> 01:17:43,260
I've been amongst them
a long time now.

1392
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,527
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

1393
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:48,529
They are worth saving.

1394
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,574
Hmm.

1395
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,231
[animal squawking]

1396
01:18:23,401 --> 01:18:24,939
What if we didn't
destroy it?

1397
01:18:27,339 --> 01:18:32,606
Maybe there's another way
to-- to save both our homes.

1398
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:35,752
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1399
01:18:37,481 --> 01:18:39,052
This is different.

1400
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,287
I can't fail at this.

1401
01:18:44,092 --> 01:18:46,323
I can't let my family down.

1402
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:49,392
You're just like him.
You know that?

1403
01:18:49,427 --> 01:18:50,756
Who?

1404
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:51,999
Optimus.

1405
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:55,068
I'm serious.

1406
01:18:55,103 --> 01:18:58,500
He feels it too.
Feels what?

1407
01:18:58,535 --> 01:19:00,667
Like a beast of burden

1408
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:04,605
just trying to carry
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

1409
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,577
You think he's some--
some general barking orders,

1410
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,920
but when I look at him,

1411
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:14,857
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1412
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:37,770
[animal chittering]

1413
01:19:47,155 --> 01:19:49,188
[chittering continues]

1414
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,533
[chittering continues]

1415
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,475
[squawking]

1416
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,850
[Elena] Are you okay?

1417
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:19,746
[groaning]

1418
01:20:20,452 --> 01:20:21,583
Airazor?

1419
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:25,323
I can feel Scourge!

1420
01:20:25,358 --> 01:20:27,930
He's...
[distorted] ...in my mind.

1421
01:20:27,965 --> 01:20:29,998
[groaning continues]

1422
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,869
[horn blowing]

1423
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:37,302
[screeching]

1424
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:39,942
[screams]
[Prime] Run, Elena!

1425
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,045
[Primal] No!

1426
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,146
[screeches]

1427
01:20:47,611 --> 01:20:50,645
Airazor.
[Airazor screeches]

1428
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,086
[Prime] They found us.

1429
01:20:52,121 --> 01:20:55,551
Everyone,
defensive positions!

1430
01:20:55,586 --> 01:20:58,191
Noah, guard the key.

1431
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:01,392
Take Elena
and find someplace safe
to hide.

1432
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:04,791
We must protect
the humans.

1433
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,562
[grunting]

1434
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,235
Miss me?

1435
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,172
[Mirage] Noah, Elena,
get out of here!

1436
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,516
[gasps]

1437
01:21:28,157 --> 01:21:29,849
We have to destroy it.

1438
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,259
Noah!

1439
01:21:33,294 --> 01:21:34,821
[Prime] No!

1440
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,428
Don't.

1441
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:43,698
I know you want
to protect your people,

1442
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,470
but if you destroy that key,

1443
01:21:46,505 --> 01:21:49,440
our home will be lost forever.

1444
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:51,739
We do not have to choose.

1445
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:56,612
[weapon humming]

1446
01:21:58,484 --> 01:22:00,319
Please, Noah.

1447
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,358
[humming stops]
[weapon beeps]

1448
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,795
[Airazor screeches]

1449
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,071
[Noah, Elena grunt]

1450
01:22:18,669 --> 01:22:20,372
Elena!

1451
01:22:24,741 --> 01:22:25,773
Go!

1452
01:22:29,713 --> 01:22:31,119
[Airazor screeches]

1453
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:32,978
[grunting]

1454
01:22:33,013 --> 01:22:35,816
[Elena screaming]

1455
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,494
[grunting continues]

1456
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,203
[Primal] Elena!

1457
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:58,146
Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

1458
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,907
[roars] No!

1459
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:03,613
I'm the Maximal that's going
to rip out your spark.

1460
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:06,814
[laughs]
We'll see about that.

1461
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:07,947
Kill them!

1462
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:09,190
[screeching]

1463
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:11,456
[Primal groaning]

1464
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:16,131
Airazor, no!

1465
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:19,024
[distorted]
I can't hold it back...

1466
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,960
[normal voice] ...much longer.

1467
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:23,336
[groans] Fight it, Airazor.

1468
01:23:24,339 --> 01:23:27,340
Remember our oath, Primal.

1469
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:30,035
No matter the cost.

1470
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:33,676
[Airazor]
I can't hold it back!
Airazor, no!

1471
01:23:36,516 --> 01:23:38,813
[grunting, groaning]

1472
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:40,518
[breathing heavily]

1473
01:23:40,553 --> 01:23:42,883
[grunting, groaning continue]

1474
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:46,689
Primal!

1475
01:23:49,056 --> 01:23:50,297
[screams]

1476
01:23:54,094 --> 01:23:57,337
It's okay.
[roars]

1477
01:23:57,372 --> 01:23:58,833
[Airazor] Do it.

1478
01:24:01,145 --> 01:24:03,871
[electrical humming]

1479
01:24:07,415 --> 01:24:09,041
[humming slows]

1480
01:24:13,388 --> 01:24:14,618
[humming stops]

1481
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:24,298
Primal.

1482
01:24:25,763 --> 01:24:27,598
No matter the cost.

1483
01:24:36,675 --> 01:24:38,378
Elena!
Elena, look at me.

1484
01:24:39,711 --> 01:24:40,941
Are you okay?

1485
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:45,286
Scourge has the key.

1486
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:16,185
[electrical humming]

1487
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:34,599
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1488
01:25:37,703 --> 01:25:39,670
[rumbling]

1489
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:51,484
[rumbling continues]

1490
01:26:10,505 --> 01:26:12,835
[key ringing]

1491
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:16,971
[key humming]

1492
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,171
[crackling]

1493
01:26:22,451 --> 01:26:25,045
[rumbling]

1494
01:26:37,697 --> 01:26:40,632
I am sorry, Noah.

1495
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,436
You were looking out
for your own.

1496
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,573
I can't even be angry
at you for that.

1497
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:52,039
On my home world,
we believe that the battle
with darkness will continue

1498
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:54,206
till all are one.

1499
01:26:55,748 --> 01:26:57,814
I lost sight of that.

1500
01:26:57,849 --> 01:27:01,884
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1501
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:05,360
when we should
have been fighting
the darkness together.

1502
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:11,465
Well, I ain't done
fighting yet.

1503
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:18,230
All right, everybody,
squad up!

1504
01:27:18,265 --> 01:27:19,902
Bring it in.

1505
01:27:19,937 --> 01:27:21,937
There's got to be a way
to stop this dude.

1506
01:27:21,972 --> 01:27:26,073
It's too late.
The Transwarp has already
been activated.

1507
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:28,845
It has more energy
than a supernova.

1508
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,749
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1509
01:27:31,784 --> 01:27:32,915
[explosion]

1510
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,785
The only way
to stop this process

1511
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,184
is an access code
installed long ago
as a safeguard.

1512
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,691
Okay, what's the code then?

1513
01:27:39,726 --> 01:27:42,397
The code was split
along with the key.

1514
01:27:42,432 --> 01:27:46,632
Sadly, the second half
of that code died
with Airazor.

1515
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,194
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1516
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:49,899
The one hiding
her half of the key--

1517
01:27:49,934 --> 01:27:51,703
that had markings in it

1518
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:54,134
just like the ones
I found in the cave
where you hid yours.

1519
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:57,203
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1520
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:58,270
Hmm.

1521
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:00,239
So we got a chance now, right?

1522
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:01,779
A slim chance.

1523
01:28:01,814 --> 01:28:03,748
That is all we need

1524
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:06,322
if you will show us the way,
Primal.

1525
01:28:09,349 --> 01:28:12,086
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1526
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,319
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1527
01:28:14,354 --> 01:28:16,156
large enough
for Unicron to enter.

1528
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:19,467
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1529
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:21,832
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

1530
01:28:21,867 --> 01:28:23,669
But not for humans.

1531
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:27,442
[Optimal] If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1532
01:28:27,477 --> 01:28:29,939
they can use the code
to shut it down,

1533
01:28:29,974 --> 01:28:32,612
remove the Transwarp Key...
[humming]

1534
01:28:32,647 --> 01:28:36,616
...and close the portal
before Unicron enters
our atmosphere.

1535
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:38,816
But Scourge
will be watching
our every move.

1536
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:41,313
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1537
01:28:41,348 --> 01:28:43,524
Then we bring
the fight to him.

1538
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:45,856
Autobots and Maximals

1539
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:48,221
will charge the bridge
together

1540
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,894
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1541
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:53,798
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1542
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:56,933
[rumbling]

1543
01:28:56,968 --> 01:28:59,199
It sounds like
we're all going to die.

1544
01:29:00,873 --> 01:29:05,546
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1545
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:07,548
all as one.

1546
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:10,045
[rumbling]

1547
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,597
This world is yours,
master.

1548
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:26,325
Scourge,

1549
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,700
they're back.

1550
01:29:33,169 --> 01:29:36,775
[growls] Prime.

1551
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:42,242
Protect the key.
Don't let them get
to the bridge.

1552
01:29:43,718 --> 01:29:45,047
[screeches]

1553
01:29:52,056 --> 01:29:53,495
[shrieks]

1554
