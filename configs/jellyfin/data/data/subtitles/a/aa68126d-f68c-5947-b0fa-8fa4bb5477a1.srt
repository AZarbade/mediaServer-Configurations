1
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:17,408
(Mashle: Magic and Muscle)

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,990
In the battle with the Magia Lupus,

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,390
Lance easily defeated

4
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,270
the Third Fang, Wirth Madl.

5
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,720
Meanwhile, Mashle also defeated

6
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,470
the Second Fang, Abyss Razor.

7
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,270
Now, for Dot and Finn, the battle
with rivals is about to begin.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,680
Let's go underground.

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,710
Disclose.

10
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,850
What a bossy old man.

11
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,410
-LOVE, I'll leave it to you here.
-Understood.

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,540
-Bastard, where are you going…
-Listen to me.

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,630
I'm the Fifth Fang of Magia Lupus.
You can call me little LOVE.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hmm?

15
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,900
Do you like me?

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,420
Eh?

17
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,430
Speak up, do you like or dislike me?

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,420
Eh, this is the first time
we see each other?

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,760
Right, Finn?

20
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,180
Mm…mm.

21
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,740
So, am I cute?

22
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,980
Come on, speak up.

23
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,570
Am I cute or not?

24
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Just say I'm cute.

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,440
How can she be so dramatic?

26
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,080
Anyone else seeing this would
probably get sick to death.

27
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,870
Am I cute or not?

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,420
But I like girls like her!

29
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
However,

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,180
I already have Lemon as my fiancee.

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,670
I'm very sorry.

32
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,300
I can't marry you.

33
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,320
What are these two talking about?

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Have you liked someone?

35
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Yes.

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
Do you like her more than you like me?

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Sorry.

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,110
I see.

39
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Then I'll

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,970
kill you.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
How can she be so fickle?

42
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,740
Tornegus!

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,010
Explomb!

44
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh, no.

45
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,560
There's obviously a gap in magical power

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,270
between me and two-mark Mages.

47
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,670
Girls

48
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,930
are born as princesses!

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,120
They should be praised,
spoiled and cherished.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,210
Men who can't do these things

51
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,990
should just die!

52
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,490
Isn't that too extreme?

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,120
It's scary.

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,200
I'll ask you again.

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,770
Do you like or dislike me?

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,130
I can't stand it.

57
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,130
She has just met us.

58
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,020
And now she wants to kill everyone
who dislikes her. Is she crazy?

59
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,120
Speak up, am I cute?

60
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,630
But I like girls like her!

61
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,790
However,

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,730
I already have Lemon as my fiancee.

63
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,570
I apologize again.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,460
I can't marry you.

65
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm having a sense of déjà vu.

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm really sorry.

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm actually very faithful…

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,420
Ah!

69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,510
Dot!

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,810
Nice.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,010
What's nice about this?

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,840
I don't have a choice.

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,180
Men who don't cherish me should be killed.

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,180
That's what my dad told me.

75
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Then please send a message to your dad.

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,200
He's wrong!

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,740
Explomb!

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,020
With your magical power,
you can't compete with me.

79
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,330
Don't you understand?

80
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,650
Tornegus!

81
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,530
What? He aimed in front of me
to block my vision.

82
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,970
He wants the magic wand.

83
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,800
What a pity.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,830
You're too weak to defeat me.

85
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,160
Let me tell you some good news.

86
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,520
The Fourth Fang of Magia Lupus,

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,230
Milo Genius,

88
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,630
has the magic that can
petrify a specific person.

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,810
The premise to become a specific target

90
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,360
is to open the door leading underground.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,570
It takes about two hours
to accumulate magic power

92
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,230
and use the spell.

93
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,600
That is to say,

94
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,810
if you can't defeat me within 30 minutes
and fight the Fourth Fang,

95
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,830
that mushroom head will turn into a stone.

96
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,970
But you can't possibly defeat me anyway.

97
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,080
Tornegus Cage!

98
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,060
Once you're caught in it,
you'll never get out!

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Dot!

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,300
The mushroom head has made friends
with someone so weak.

101
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,940
I feel sorry for him.

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,440
But why does he have
to go against Lord Abel?

103
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,210
Challenging others without
knowing their strength.

104
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,970
He's as stupid as you.

105
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,310
It's hilarious.

106
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,620
My whole body hurts.

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,170
I can feel it deep in my bones.

108
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,670
Even breathing is difficult.

109
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,270
She is right.

110
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,430
The gap between our
strengths is too great.

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,320
There's no point in continuing the fight.

112
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,740
Hey, Dot.

113
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
You bought a new broom, right?

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,610
Swap it with mine.

115
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,520
Uh, well.

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
This broom is…

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,330
It's alright, right?

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,960
Mm…mm.

119
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,400
Thanks.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,020
Here you go.

121
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,520
Thank you, sister.

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,630
Don't be a coward.

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,190
At least fight back.

124
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,100
It's okay.

125
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,870
Fighting back will only make it worse.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,700
You give up so easily.

127
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
But

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
the thing is

129
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,510
when you make a real friend…

130
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,920
A real friend?

131
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,040
Right, someone who will
cry and get angry for you.

132
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,640
You might not meet one
in your entire life,

133
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,720
but if you do make such a friend,

134
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,910
you shall never betray them.

135
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,740
In other words, he's got
a lot of confidence.

136
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you really think
you're the protagonist?

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Right.

138
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,810
You're disgusting.

139
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
I really dislike

140
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,730
hot-blooded men like you.

141
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm really a coward.

142
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,910
That's enough.

143
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,310
I got scared while my friend was mocked.

144
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,900
Come at me, scum.

145
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,390
My friend got so angry

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,810
for me!

147
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,120
So, in the meantime,

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,340
I'll finish off this freckled guy here.

149
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,240
Bye.

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
Tor…

151
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,000
…negus.

152
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,810
It can't end like this.

153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,490
She mocked my friend!

154
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,960
What's with this amount of magic power?

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,040
He broke my spell?

156
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,970
Dot?

157
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,020
Can't you just pass out? So annoying!

158
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,640
Tornegus!

159
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
Explomb!

160
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,310
What?

161
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,190
They have been offset?

162
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,800
His magic power
has increased significantly?

163
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,650
Can he do that?

164
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,180
No, that mark…

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,910
I've heard of it.

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,100
He was born with a Warding
Cross mark on the forehead.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,910
A battle demon race that
can release magic power

168
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,440
when their emotions reach a certain level.

169
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,700
The Ira Kreuz!

170
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,770
Mocking my friend is a great sin.

171
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,890
Machine gun

172
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,850
Explomb!

173
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,270
You said he will be
petrified in 30 minutes?

174
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,780
I won't let you stop him.

175
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,630
Come at me,

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
scum.

177
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,580
Die a hundred times!

178
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,680
What? He missed on purpose.

179
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,480
I have no interest in torturing women.

180
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Get lost.

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,160
Before I change my mind.

182
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,410
Okay.

183
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,840
Thank you so much.

184
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,740
Piece of cake!

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,460
Now he's back to his old self.

186
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,520
But he can handle the
Fifth Fang just by himself.

187
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,780
Has Dot also reached the two-mark level?

188
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,090
That's amazing, Dot…

189
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,800
Dot.

190
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,420
Sorry, Dot!

191
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,180
I thought you'd be able to finish off
the two one-mark Mages with ease.

192
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,490
How did you end up like this?

193
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Ah?

194
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,310
Sorry about that.

195
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,210
The Fourth Fang.

196
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,480
He gave up the petrification
magic and showed himself?

197
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,720
They are not like people who
have ever proved to be

198
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,350
a real challenge.

199
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,480
Damn it.

200
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
He caught me off guard.

201
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,340
Can I beat the Fourth Fang
with my strength?

202
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,940
The Fourth Fang is the only first-year
student who made it into the Magia Lupus.

203
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,600
They're done for.

204
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,290
What was that?

205
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,770
A sword?

206
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,490
That magic is…

207
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,480
Damn it, what happened?

208
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,110
How did they

209
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,800
break my spell in an instant?

210
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,060
Why are you here?

211
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,600
Divine Visionary, Rayne Ames.

212
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,670
Wait, Rayne, why are you here?

213
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,400
Divine Visionary, Rayne Ames.

214
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,040
The top one of Adler.

215
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,490
As a Divine Visionary,
he is also a student like us.

216
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,680
I don't need to panic.

217
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,270
Right, let's chat.

218
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,680
We all have our reasons, right?

219
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,790
Right?

220
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,730
What?

221
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,420
Don't waste my time.

222
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,710
Scum.

223
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,480
We're all students, right?

224
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,120
This is the magic of a Divine Visionary.

225
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,050
Why don't we transfer to Adler?

226
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,390
Oh no, he's so much stronger.

227
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,050
He is superior in every way.

228
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,970
Listen to me. I had no choice!

229
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm also reflecting on
why I didn't disobey them.

230
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,960
Forgive me, please!

231
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,200
I see.

232
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,240
You're reflecting, huh?

233
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,520
The most important thing in this world

234
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,080
is actions, not words.

235
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,960
I would never believe
the words of scum like you.

236
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,900
People like you

237
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,200
have to learn your lesson the hard way.

238
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,500
I just need to beat you

239
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,670
until you dare not make
the same mistake again.

240
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,140
I heard he's also from Adler,
so he should be on our side, right?

241
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,730
What are you guys doing here?

242
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,630
Go back.

243
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,300
I still need to get the story out of him.

244
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,450
Okay.

245
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,100
Speak up.

246
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,990
So cruel.

247
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,040
By the way, why is the
Divine Visionary here?

248
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,590
-Senior.
-Huh?

249
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,630
Old man said that the followers of
the Innocent Zero have come here.

250
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,500
They must have suppressed their
magic power and sneaked in here.

251
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,880
Where are they hiding?

252
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,910
Getting nutrition, getting nutrition.

253
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,650
This isn't magic power.

254
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,610
But this immense pressure

255
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,560
is cause by him?

256
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,050
I need to hurry up.

257
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,320
Hurry up… huh?

258
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,840
I don't have much time.

259
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,810
Let me investigate you quickly.

260
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Huh?

261
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,620
Now I'm going to use it to measure
your true magic power.

262
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,050
then I'll know if you're a student or not.

263
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,800
Huh?

264
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,720
Up to now, I have measured the magic
power of thousands of Mages. Spider.

265
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,750
Lord Rayne said,

266
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,300
if you're a regular Mage,
I'll let you go. Spider.

267
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
But…

268
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,100
Hey, what are you doing?

269
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,130
This is so dangerous.

270
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Suspicious individual.

271
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,590
-Barbarian.
-Did he

272
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,640
use magic just now?

273
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,050
Ah, ba, ah ba ba ba ba.

274
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,700
It's zero.

275
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,760
No, it's impossible, impossible.

276
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,910
There might have been a mistake.

277
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,190
The measuring spider didn't react at all.

278
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,270
Could it be...

279
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
Eh?

280
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,510
Three Percent Partisan.

281
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,610
He turned my Partisan into a chair.

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,170
No way.

283
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,050
The measuring spider is so surprised

284
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,960
that it forgot to mention
"spider" at the end.

285
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,200
He really didn't use magic.

286
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,880
- I'm getting angry.
- He's not from Innocent Zero, but…

287
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,000
Let me try again.

288
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,660
Ten Percent

289
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,770
Partisan.

290
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,120
Lord Rayne wouldn't use it on a student.

291
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,480
This guy is dead…

292
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
What?

293
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,040
Swinging in the air?

294
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,370
Could it be...

295
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,360
Is that

296
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,950
a bunting stance?

297
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,310
Ah, he has used bunting moves to stop

298
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,460
all Rayne's attacks!

299
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,860
That is dangerous.

300
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,000
No, what's going on?

301
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,610
What's your name?

302
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Mashle Burnedead.

303
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,160
Mashle.

304
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,010
We have an interesting
new student in our school.

305
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,840
Although his situation is quite special,

306
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,030
his mind is very strong.

307
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,480
I hope you can take
good care of him, Rayne.

308
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,550
His name is...

309
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,520
Burnedead.

310
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,560
So it's you.

311
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,520
Please forgive my rudeness earlier.

312
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm very sorry.

313
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I won't forgive you.

314
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,610
Here, take this as an apology.

315
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,180
A magic handkerchief that heals wounds.

316
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,420
Ah, alright.

317
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,760
Eh?

318
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,110
You like rabbits?

319
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,030
Thank you very much.

320
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,310
And be careful from now on.

321
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,450
You're going to see Abel, right?

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,010
How do you know?

323
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,980
I heard it from the old man that
you want to become a Divine Visionary too.

324
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,560
So you'll definitely run up against Abel.

325
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,880
Without a doubt, he is one of candidates
for Divine Visionary this year.

326
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,120
His puppet magic exceeds
what's required for a student.

327
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,220
Although I am surprised that you could
block my basic magic with bare hands,

328
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,660
it's a bit difficult for you to defeat
Abel since you cannot use the magic.

329
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,440
But I can use magic.

330
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,480
However,

331
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,520
Abel has almost all the credit coins.

332
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,680
By defeating him, you can
get all his credit coins

333
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,840
and become a strong candidate
for a Divine Visionary.

334
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,400
Nowadays, there are many problems
with the Realm of Magic.

335
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,020
So the stronger ones we have, the better.

336
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,920
Since you said you want to
become a Divine Visionary,

337
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,420
you must do it at all costs.

338
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,800
Alright.

339
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,100
I have other things to do.

340
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,960
Take care.

341
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,230
Ah, thank you for helping me so much.

342
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,980
I did all this for myself.

343
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,120
Don't get me wrong.

344
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,210
Goodbye.

345
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,840
He should be a good person.

346
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,850
He's an interesting kid who values
his friends' issues more than his own.

347
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,080
Well, maybe he's just simple-minded.

348
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,120
But it's a fact that your younger brother
was saved because of him.

349
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,160
To become a Divine Visionary
without knowing how to use the magic.

350
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,920
For that,

351
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,460
you have to prove to me

352
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,320
that you're better than Mages.

353
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,400
Is it here?

354
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,060
Should I push or pull this door?

355
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,920
Ah, push.

356
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Do you have to break the door every time?

357
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,280
Actually,

358
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,610
I just knocked on it.

359
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:44,698
