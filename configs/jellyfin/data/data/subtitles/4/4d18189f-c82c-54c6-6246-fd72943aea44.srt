1
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:08,962
Abyss Razor.

2
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:10,884
From now on,

3
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:13,828
I will give meaning to that eye of yours.

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,103
From today, you'll be my tool.

5
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:22,114
Follow me.

6
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,330
Lord Abel.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,584
(Mashle: Magic and Muscle)

8
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,651
Just as Mashle and his friends

9
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,848
defeated the Magia Lupus…

10
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:11,232
How is Mashle doing now?

11
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,418
He didn't cause a huge commotion

12
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,904
by revealing that he
can't use magic, did he?

13
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:23,436
That guy must become a Divine Visionary.
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

14
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,681
This is also for my own plans.

15
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:30,549
Don't you have work?

16
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,068
What's more important?
Work or making an appearance?

17
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,076
Making an appearance is indeed important.

18
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,380
Yeah, I agree.

19
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,051
Would you like another cup of tea?

20
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:41,520
Hmm.

21
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:44,548
Let me introduce this again.

22
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:46,573
This story is about

23
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,236
Mashle Burnedead, who has no magic power,

24
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,483
and his experience
in Easton Magic Academy

25
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,638
before he becomes a Divine Visionary…

26
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,460
They're still celebrating here!

27
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:00,649
Protagonist! Protagonist! Protagonist!

28
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:02,282
Heroine! Heroine!

29
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,330
I'm the heroine!

30
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,906
-Are you the hero?
-Oh yeah.

31
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,790
How long will they keep celebrating?

32
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:16,846
How long will they keep celebrating?

33
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:21,056
Ah, can I go to the restroom?

34
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:27,876
He must have wanted to go long ago.

35
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:31,092
Well, I guess this is the end.

36
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:32,564
Yeah.

37
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:37,082
The students who turned into dolls
have all restored to human form.

38
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:41,625
But the security at
this school is really bad.

39
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:44,979
The thrill can also
stimulate our love though.

40
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:46,662
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,075
By the way, where's that pretty boy?

42
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,732
He didn't lose, did he?

43
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,709
I don't think Lance would lose.

44
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:59,191
Hmm? That was fast…

45
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:01,650
Who are you?

46
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:04,592
Don't get in my way.

47
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:12,584
Ouch, what are you doing?

48
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,499
Why are you all battered?

49
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,796
Did you lose?

50
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:36,343
You can't even be the strongest
student in this school?

51
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,883
How embarrassing.

52
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,208
However, I'm still grateful to you.

53
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,600
Thank you for collecting information

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,456
about Principal Wahlberg.

55
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,141
My… arms…

56
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:59,270
The searching didn't go very well,

57
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,204
but in fact,

58
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,278
you don't have a reason to exist

59
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,268
-anymore.
-So

60
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,245
let's have orange juice and
cream puffs for the celebration.

61
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:18,241
Why's there a brat who
can't read the atmosphere?

62
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,511
Huh? The vibe feels a bit strange.

63
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:23,938
No, Mashle.

64
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,602
Now is not the time for that.

65
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,626
Where did he get the cream puffs from?

66
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:50,523
Is this a coincidence?

67
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,711
Or is it on purpose?

68
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:00,389
I'm very sorry.

69
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,629
I still want to eat that.
Can you give it back to me?

70
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:06,878
He still wants to eat that cream puff?

71
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,960
SHOCKED

72
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:14,868
You are such a rude guy.

73
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,338
What's with this headache?

74
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,069
Could it be… resonance?

75
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:23,164
But,

76
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,660
I didn't have a headache
when I first came here.

77
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,053
Is it because of

78
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:31,061
this guy who just came in?

79
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,030
Uh, this guy…

80
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:42,485
Ah, this guy is the one
we're looking for…

81
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,038
Forget it.

82
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,220
I'll go ahead with the plan

83
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:56,064
and kill Abel first.

84
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,037
It's useless.

85
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,173
The difference in our abilities as Mages

86
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,861
is too great.

87
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:07,946
Die.

88
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,127
Abyss!

89
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:22,639
Masked guy!

90
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,505
I'm sorry, Mashle.

91
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,597
I'm afraid I can't

92
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,373
have cream puffs with you anymore.

93
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,075
Take this.

94
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:46,827
Magic handkerchief.

95
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:51,307
My attack didn't cause a fatal injury.

96
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,977
That mushroom head

97
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,243
threw a stone at me at that moment,

98
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,201
causing the magic trajectory to deviate.

99
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,107
It's him.

100
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:10,545
Are you Abel's dog? Quite active, huh?

101
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:14,635
An adopted social scourge
returning the favor?

102
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,892
You make me sick.

103
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:24,570
He stepped on the ground…

104
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:37,745
He caught it!

105
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,025
What?

106
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:45,674
You are quite rebellious.

107
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:50,915
Then you can die with him.

108
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,795
Eh, why are you licking the stone?

109
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,188
Is that what people your age do?

110
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,025
Whatever.

111
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:03,737
I'm taking masked guy to the hospital now.

112
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,655
If you dare stop me, I'll beat you up.

113
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:10,255
Beat me up?

114
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,170
Not bad.

115
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,624
He still has thirty minutes.

116
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,618
Can you really save him

117
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,157
in the time he has left?

118
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:31,992
What?

119
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,360
Didn't you say you were
going to beat me up?

120
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:42,105
Seems like you're all talk.

121
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:51,378
I can't win against him.

122
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,081
The difference in our
talent is too great.

123
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,081
Talent…

124
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,933
My mother often told me,

125
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,928
we

126
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,448
just happened to be born into privilege.

127
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:11,155
Background, talent,
appearance, all these things.

128
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:15,391
We just got them by
being luckier than others.

129
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:17,600
So…

130
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,485
Don't space out, Abel!

131
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,220
Carbon rain!

132
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:27,928
It's no use.

133
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:31,025
We are at an absolute disadvantage now.

134
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,225
We can't win against him.

135
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,951
Stupid Abyss.

136
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:38,795
There was no need

137
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:41,789
to protect me.

138
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,621
I think he used to be very happy.

139
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,718
He was always lonely.

140
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:53,779
It was hard enough for him to survive.

141
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:56,803
So,

142
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,593
when he knew you needed him,

143
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,539
he must have been very happy.

144
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,827
And I share his feelings.

145
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,103
So

146
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,189
I will save you.

147
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:14,221
The masked guy must want
to eat cream puffs too.

148
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:20,173
We just happened to
be born into privilege.

149
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,653
Background, talent, appearance,
we got these by chance.

150
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:26,799
So, Abel,

151
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,407
you should think from
other people's perspectives.

152
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,458
That way,

153
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,679
you'll be gentler to others.

154
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,211
That's right, gentle.

155
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,122
Be gentler to others.

156
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:50,799
Haven't you given up yet?

157
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:52,801
Carbon rain!

158
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,616
Lord Abel.

159
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,200
Abyss.

160
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:06,959
Ah, it's the Evil Eye! Run!

161
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,965
Don't come near me!

162
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,784
I wish I hadn't given birth to you.

163
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,100
I'm really sorry I was
born into this world.

165
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:21,186
I heard about it.

166
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,946
You have the Evil Eye.

167
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,009
I'm sorry, I'll try to avoid
eye contact with you.

168
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,029
You don't need to hide.

169
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,253
Can your eye be of use to me?

170
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,332
I wouldn't dare.

171
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,184
If you use this eye,

172
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,360
you'll be ostracized by
those around you too.

173
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,027
That doesn't matter.

174
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:51,235
From now on, I'll give meaning
to that eye of yours.

175
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,379
From today, you'll be my tool.

176
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,178
Follow me.

177
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,627
Please… please,

178
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:11,022
please run away.

179
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:15,106
You just say nice things.

180
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:17,914
Be it my mother

181
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,666
or Abyss.

182
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:24,787
Carbon rain!

183
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,025
Have you used up all your
strength just blocking my attack?

184
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,047
Pathetic, how pathetic.

185
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:39,409
If you don't hurry, he'll die.

186
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:40,917
Mashle.

187
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:42,389
Not good.

188
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:44,674
Those carbon-like solids

189
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:47,224
are hard and numerous.

190
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,844
Although Mashle is moving
forward little by little,

191
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,532
there's not enough time
for him to reach the opponent.

192
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,278
That being said,

193
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,627
if I go to help Mashle,

194
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:00,419
these two will be in danger.

195
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,498
I can't help him.

196
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,562
I'm fed up.

197
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,221
Carbon Heavy Rain!

198
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,821
He has even more advanced magic!

199
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,407
Damn it! Even if I could help,
it might be too late.

200
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,192
Should I go help him?

201
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:20,653
Damn it!

202
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:26,217
Mashle.

203
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,983
The exploitation of the weak by the strong

204
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:40,216
is a natural right.

205
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:42,078
But,

206
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,598
resisting the strong

207
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,247
is also the natural right of the weak.

208
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,686
What do you want to do, Abel?

209
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,759
I want to verify what's right

210
00:14:57,993 --> 00:14:59,743
with my own hands.

211
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,664
Hmm, is that so?

212
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:08,268
Carbon Heavy Rain!

213
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,231
Unfortunately,

214
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,585
you can't win with this level of magic…

215
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:24,854
Hello.

216
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,759
This is the first time

217
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,772
someone has been able
to break my hard shell.

218
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:42,388
Although it was a sneak attack.

219
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,135
What magic did you use?

220
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,231
I'm asking what your personal magic is.

221
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,072
Uh, I…

222
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:54,721
Power.

223
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,257
Power?

224
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:58,065
Is there such magic?

225
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,749
I see you're not planning to tell me.

226
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,006
Fine, it doesn't matter.

227
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:06,289
That is…

228
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:08,326
The Anti-Magic Mirror!

229
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:12,393
A magical tool that reflects
any magic attack.

230
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,149
That is to say,

231
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:17,702
the stronger the opponent's magic,
the more powerful the mirror becomes.

232
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:22,797
It's the most feared
magical tool by all Mages!

233
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,530
It should be under the Bureau's control.

234
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,550
Why…

235
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,681
Stop it, Mashle!

236
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:31,686
That's something we Mages
absolutely cannot confront.

237
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,814
The magic you cast will
be reflected on yourself!

238
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:38,334
One wrong step and
you'll be in grave danger!

239
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:40,273
To confront that thing,

240
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,961
you have to break through
it in a non-magical way.

241
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,887
But that's…

242
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,663
Because you got in my way,

243
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:52,440
I'll make all of you regret it.

244
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:56,198
Come on, use your magic,

245
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:00,358
as long as you don't mind rotting
in your own magical power.

246
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,337
Can you do it…

247
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:14,639
Magic…

248
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:15,886
Magic…

249
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,389
Magic…

250
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,234
This is not magic!

251
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,468
So, back then…

252
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,420
And then…

253
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,489
And then…

254
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,092
And then…

255
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,109
And then…

256
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:32,132
And then…

257
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,726
And now too!

258
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,568
That is to say, all those things
he did weren't magic.

259
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,805
Mashle did it solely by his own body…

260
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:43,839
Is this really possible?

261
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,899
Isn't that strange?

262
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,736
This has become a fantasy story, right?

263
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,784
Isn't it a fantasy story?

264
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:55,079
It's already a fantasy story, this…

265
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:01,434
Completely ineffective!

266
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,178
Did it appear the moment
I made contact with that brat?

267
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,135
If it's just the headache from earlier…

268
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,057
As expected, it's this guy.

269
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,701
Is it?

270
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,790
What is that!

271
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,691
Today, I had an unexpected reward.

272
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:37,157
Because I met you.

273
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,611
My name is Cell War.

274
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,813
INNOCENT ZERO CELL WAR

275
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,153
I have urgent matters,
so I'll be leaving now.

276
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,794
But I think we'll meet again soon.

277
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,242
Bye bye.

278
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:01,818
He really left like he said.

279
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:02,858
I'm really grateful.

280
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,856
Come on, let's take masked
guy to the hospital.

281
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,488
You don't have to worry about that.

282
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,677
Thanks to the handkerchief you gave me.

283
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,853
He's alright now.

284
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,807
Next time,

285
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:21,593
you have to treat me

286
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,351
to cream puffs, okay?

287
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:26,520
Masked guy.

288
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:31,164
I'll get Abyss to the hospital.

289
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:40,279
I want to thank you, Mashle Burnedead.

290
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,031
I'll definitely return this favor.

291
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:51,208
This thing is finally over.

292
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,077
Ah, it's not!

293
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:56,344
Everything you've done
till now isn't magic?

294
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,793
That's even more amazing.

295
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:59,864
It'll get you into trouble
if anyone else finds out.

296
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:01,643
You'll be in trouble, Mashle.

297
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,828
You might be expelled because of that.

298
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:11,394
No… that… that is magic.

299
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,934
He looks so nervous.

300
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,027
Is there a reason in it?

301
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:16,964
Anyway,

302
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,806
we need to keep his secret

303
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,259
to protect him from the others.

304
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,659
That's right.

305
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,955
If Mashle gets into trouble,

306
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,710
it'll also damage our marriage.

307
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,183
For now, let's hide Mashle

308
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,231
before taking the next steps.

309
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,049
Thank you, guys.

310
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:35,057
He actually said thank you.

311
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,849
I didn't expect us to be unanimous.

312
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,868
No, it seems things have gotten worse.

313
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,665
If his secret gets exposed,

314
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,958
we'll definitely face consequences.

315
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,327
We'll also be expelled.

316
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,648
No!

317
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,341
I heard everything.

318
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,193
A person who can't use
magic is in this school.

319
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:54,324
That's something serious.

320
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:56,714
I'm going to report you to the professor.

321
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,501
What… it's over.

322
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,485
The students turned into puppets…

323
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,352
They've all regained consciousness.

324
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,880
A student who can't use magic
is in a magic school.

325
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
Report, report, report!

326
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,993
DEPRESSED

327
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:14,304
This moment has finally come.

328
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,319
He's not affected at all.

329
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,708
The fact that Mashle can't use magic

330
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,575
has finally been exposed.

331
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,071
What do you do, Mashle?

332
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:30,983
Your happy life with your Pop

333
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:32,532
is in danger now!

334
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,067
Father,

335
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:17,651
I'm sorry that this took some time.

336
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:21,257
I finally found

337
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,113
the thing we lost.

338
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:28,412
You did? Finally…

339
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,188
My longtime wish is about to come true.

340
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,360
Go and catch him.
