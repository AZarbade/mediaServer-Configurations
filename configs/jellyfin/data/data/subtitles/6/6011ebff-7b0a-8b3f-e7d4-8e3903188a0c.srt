1
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:17,413
(Mashle: Magic and Muscle)

2
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,051
To be honest, I'm quite surprised.

3
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,610
Abyss.

4
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:55,833
Other than Rayne,
there are other students

5
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:58,671
who can fight against his Evil Eye.

6
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,886
It's hard to imagine
someone better at magic

7
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,533
than the Divine Visionary, Rayne.

8
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,942
Could it be that you...

9
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,931
Ah, um.

10
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,533
What's wrong with you?

11
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,930
No, nothing.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,152
Please continue.

13
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,991
You seem to be a rare talent
with great potential.

14
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,815
Hm.

15
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:26,737
But someone as outstanding as you

16
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,319
should be able to clearly recognize

17
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,342
that there is no real
equality in this world.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,008
I've said it before,

19
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,696
our nature is that of beasts.

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,525
I can't tolerate the
existence of inferior genes.

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,056
Those who enjoy unearned success

22
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,423
become arrogant
once they are treated kindly.

23
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,207
They just go around
advocating their rights.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,304
Don't you find them shameless?

25
00:02:56,425 --> 00:03:00,137
We don't need to carry such burdens.

26
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,165
So, you meant

27
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,277
people who can't use magic...

28
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,753
Yes, that's right.

29
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:10,353
They should all be executed.

30
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,161
Shocking.

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,028
They are just being isolated for now,
that is not enough.

32
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,598
I want to change the situation.

33
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,269
Of course, it also includes other burdens

34
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:24,826
and those who protect them.

35
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:27,751
Those who protect them?

36
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,074
Mashle.

37
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,836
You're such a gentle and honest child.

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,960
You can do a double backflip
at such a young age!

39
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,585
Here, have my cream puff too...

40
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,053
You ate it before I finished talking.

41
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:55,799
Mashle, I'm so proud of you.

42
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,588
Is that so? Well.

43
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,786
In that case, I'm in a dilemma.

44
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,258
It seems we can't get along well.

45
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,433
Is that so? It seems you
don't understand what I said.

46
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,230
You don't seem very bright.

47
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:21,292
We can't leave inferior genes untreated.

48
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,467
I did so much work today.

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,448
Eh? Why's the door broken?

50
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,818
Lord Abel is fighting that mushroom head.

51
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,948
Now of all times.

52
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,044
Acid was injected into those puppets.

53
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:53,354
You better be careful.

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,524
Is that so?

55
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,790
How does he plan to deal with this?

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,924
With just one throw,

57
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,652
he knocked them all down without
even touching the acid puppets.

58
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,571
Hey.

59
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,069
You just said something
about inferior genes, right?

60
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,957
If I win,

61
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,733
does that mean you have the inferior gene?

62
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,346
You're quite stubborn.

63
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,010
Also,

64
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,047
where is Lemon?

65
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,540
Lemon? I don't know
who you're talking about.

66
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,158
I just absorbed some magic
power from those people.

67
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,857
Just?

68
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:59,093
Everyone is getting weaker because of you.

69
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,063
I've said it.

70
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,527
The exploitation of the weak by the strong

71
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,014
is their natural right.

72
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,802
You can't even stop their magic
power from being absorbed.

73
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:15,725
And that's exactly your current level.

74
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,338
It's over!

75
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,460
This guy

76
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,689
is stronger than when I last saw him.

77
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,732
You said the exploitation
of the weak by the strong

78
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,911
is their natural right, right?

79
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,882
So,

80
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,933
if I win, you'll tell me

81
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,045
where Lemon is.

82
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,356
I might as well go back home.

83
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,281
It seems you do have
the strength to talk big.

84
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,177
Thank you.

85
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,056
But there's nothing more than that.

86
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:14,907
What was that just now?

87
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,699
Sorry.

88
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:19,387
It's a bit monotonous going on like this.

89
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,258
There's no fun.

90
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,424
Finn...

91
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:27,861
He's your friend, right?

92
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,399
I brought him here to have some fun.

93
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,732
Your spiky-head friend has
been severely injured

94
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,705
and can no longer be of any use.

95
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,717
I hope you can show me something exciting.

96
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,364
Did I say you could take action?

97
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,527
Sorry, you're not allowed to do so.

98
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,656
If you don't follow the rules,

99
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:58,980
he'll be torn to pieces.

100
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,210
Is that so?

101
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,222
You can really do such a thing?

102
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,165
Well, unless you don't care about
your friend being torn apart.

103
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,385
Otherwise,

104
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,401
you'll be the one torn apart first.

105
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,377
Can't you do it?

106
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,837
Can't you give up your friend?

107
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,050
After all, everyone wants
to be a good person.

108
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,205
But like I said,

109
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,740
it's a lie.

110
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,425
The weapon broke first.

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,402
It seems you still think

112
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,745
you're an unfathomable person.

113
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:52,217
There is a war!

114
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,847
Ah, right.

115
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:56,421
You said earlier you wanted to
earn gold credit coins, right?

116
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,134
Are you finally going to give them to me?

117
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,721
Well, if you really want them...

118
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,194
He used a credit coin to
break the silk threads...

119
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,010
Sorry.

120
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,462
This credit coin seems to
be very attached to me.

121
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,329
I'm tired of your constant provocations.

122
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,298
Sorry, I don't want to
play with you anymore.

123
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,624
It's useless.

124
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,409
This isn't a power humans
can fight against.

125
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,425
In the end,

126
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:40,104
you're just a manipulated human.

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,066
I don't care about what you said.

128
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,182
For what you've done

129
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,148
to my friends,

130
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,225
I'll definitely make you regret it.

131
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,358
Marioness Change.

132
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,858
It's really admirable.

133
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:30,227
I didn't expect you to
make me use this magic.

134
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:35,065
But the fact of the survival
of the fittest hasn't changed.

135
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,265
It's only natural for
the weak to be devoured.

136
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,931
In my eyes,

137
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,201
you're just a clever rabbit.

138
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,937
I'll take the credit coins.

139
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,787
You've worked hard as a rabbit,

140
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,036
but a rabbit is just a rabbit.

141
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,404
It can't become a wolf.

142
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:10,590
What's this?

143
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,306
Why is the cream puff

144
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,323
I hid in my chest here?

145
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:23,559
Usually, people don't put cream
puffs directly in their chest.

146
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,305
Why?

147
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,756
He's completely turned into a puppet.

148
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,676
How can he still move on his own?

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,776
The principle of puppetization is to cut
off the electrical signals from the brain,

150
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,343
so as to take control of the body.

151
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,897
He should be immobile.

152
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:43,385
Could it be

153
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,766
a spinal reflex?

154
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,326
Spinal reflex.

155
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,743
When people touch something
hot, their hand retracts.

156
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,151
A light tap on the lower part of the
kneecap causes a knee-jerk reflex.

157
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,630
Reflex arcs like these,
which quickly respond to

158
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,500
external threats without
involving the brain,

159
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,645
also exist inside the human body.

160
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,053
My magic

161
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,717
turns a person's shell

162
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,255
into a puppet to control them.

163
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,370
But inside, it's still a human body.

164
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,586
If they can still move autonomously
after becoming a puppet,

165
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,209
I can't think of any other situation
besides spinal reflexes.

166
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,682
In other words,

167
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,310
it's an unconscious defense reaction.

168
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,719
Why is he so reluctant?

169
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,286
It's just a cream puff!

170
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,483
Does he hate it so much

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,556
that his cream puff was stolen?

172
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,441
If this is a world of
the survival of the fittest,

173
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:46,367
then it's only natural to resist
when being plundered.

174
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,843
Fine, I acknowledge your actions.

175
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,197
I can extract magic power from puppets

176
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,272
and use it for myself.

177
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:01,111
I'll use the strongest spell

178
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,543
to defeat you.

179
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,767
Marioness Secondth.

180
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,877
Harm Puppet.

181
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,925
This spell

182
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,888
can turn everyone within
a 100-meter radius into puppets.

183
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,491
The moment the silk thread touches
the body, the puppetization starts.

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,536
Of course, you can't possibly
see those silk threads.

185
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,644
In that case, I also…

186
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:34,223
The moment the falling silk
thread touches you,

187
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,204
your body will lose control
and you won't be able to break free.

188
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,049
I will play with your
puppetized body at will,

189
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,478
until it can no longer recover.

190
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,829
This is my respect for you.

191
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,086
The lion fights the rabbit
with all its might.

192
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,875
I've done enough for you.

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,040
Consider this my gift in return.

194
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:18,113
Huh, am I being thanked?

195
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,689
How did you dodge puppetization?

196
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:22,801
I cut all the silk threads.

197
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:24,471
Impossible.

198
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,566
No way you can see
those hanging silk threads.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,923
It's not something humans
can fight against.

200
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,925
I saw them.

201
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,763
This guy unbelievably tilted his body

202
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,613
after Lord Abel used magic.

203
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,377
Now that I think about it,

204
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:43,271
he deliberately tilted his body
to delay contact with the silk thread.

205
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:46,845
The moment his left side
touched the silk thread

206
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,637
and his right side hadn't lost control
yet, he tore all the silk threads!

207
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,566
What a wild and sharp strategy.

208
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,402
It's impossible.

209
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,450
This is simply inhuman.

210
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,302
What is it?

211
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,172
You're sweating, Mr. Rabbit.

212
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,687
This is so interesting.

213
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,778
Mashle Burnedead!

214
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,464
I never had such thoughts.

215
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,406
Erector spinae magic.

216
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,198
Hell Fall.

217
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,439
I…

218
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,342
I am the rabbit.

219
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:44,653
My mother was a very gentle,

220
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,701
compassionate person.

221
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,458
Although she was a noble,

222
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,890
she always treated low-ranking people

223
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,095
equally.

224
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,975
My mother once said,

225
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:01,327
we just happened to be born
in a privileged environment.

226
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,533
But one day, my gentle
mother was assassinated.

227
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,166
That day, as usual,

228
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:12,814
she was distributing food to the poor.

229
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,012
But a man wanted to take all the food.

230
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,636
My mother was killed
in the confrontation with him.

231
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,180
That man said,

232
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,508
you're too naive and kind,

233
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,876
and you deserve to be stabbed.

234
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,250
I used to believe that
people are born good.

235
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,381
As a noble lady,

236
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,069
an innocent lady,

237
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,050
my gentle mother left me.

238
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,089
My mother was actually wrong.

239
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,737
There's no need for us to
have sympathy for them.

240
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,617
People at the bottom

241
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:55,537
have their reasons for being there.

242
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:57,841
We can never coexist peacefully.

243
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:02,897
For my own purpose,
I started gathering talented people.

244
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,209
Starting with Abyss, I looked for those who were
extremely dissatisfied with the current situation.

245
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,689
And I touched a power that
should never be touched.

246
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,522
All of this is for my purpose.

247
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,470
My thoughts have never changed.

248
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,606
It's natural for the weak
at the bottom to be hunted.

249
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,125
It's more like they must be hunted.

250
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,797
Bad people are bad,
no matter what are their origins.

251
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,253
Most of the stupid ones are at the bottom,

252
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,709
that's why I advocate
abandoning the entire bottom.

253
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,864
In that case, you're putting me
into a difficult position.

254
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,216
Really, I'm in a dilemma.

255
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,574
You've said this twice.

256
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:46,779
Let's put this aside.

257
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,537
Tell me where Lemon is.

258
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,738
After all, you lost.

259
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,196
That's true.

260
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,418
Then I'll release all the students
who became puppets.

261
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,338
After all, I lost.

262
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:03,710
Thank you.

263
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:08,508
However, you're doing all
this for your mother.

264
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,578
I don't think you are a bad person.

265
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,467
I'm a bit relieved.

266
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,383
Marioness Liberation.

267
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,305
I remember now.

268
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,918
I was captured by a puppet.

269
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:38,339
Mashle! Lemon!

270
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,132
Great, are you okay?

271
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,679
I'm sorry, I made you worry.

272
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,010
I was really worried.
Thank god you are okay.

273
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,408
What a bunch of fools.

274
00:18:58,925 --> 00:18:59,885
Mother.

275
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,150
Coin, coin, coin…

276
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,989
Hero, hero.

277
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:11,903
Marry, marry.

278
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,916
-Hero.
-Marry.

279
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,016
I was really scared.

280
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,754
-Thank you, Mashle.
-It's no big deal.

281
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:22,563
Mashle.

282
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:26,350
I'm really sorry.

283
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:27,712
It's all because of me...

284
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:31,797
But really,

285
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:38,773
I'm really, really grateful.

286
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,866
I'm glad you're okay.

287
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,307
You are too charming!

288
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,307
What?

289
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,043
I tried hard too.

290
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,636
Ah, Dot.

291
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:50,685
It's Dot!

292
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:51,773
Dot.

293
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,097
Wow, wow, wow.

294
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:58,805
They're all idiots.

295
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,527
Eh, where is Lance?

296
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,732
Eh?

297
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,420
Stop right there.

298
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,168
You're not from this school, are you?

299
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,337
What do you mean...

300
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:20,988
My magic was dispelled?

301
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,665
The counter's gone off the charts!
The counter's gone off the charts!

302
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,556
How did you find out?

303
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:30,619
Suspects get punishment, it's
the most convenient way.

304
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,914
What, you fooled me.

305
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,211
I even disguised myself as a student.

306
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,358
Innocent Zero,

307
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,755
an underground dark magic organization.

308
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,584
Why would you rats

309
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,760
come to this school?

310
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,138
Speak up, or I won't let you go.

311
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,891
I came to find something.

312
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:58,569
Find something?

313
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,783
There's something very,
very important to us.

314
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,130
It should be in this school.

315
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,050
So strange.

316
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,466
DEPRESSED

317
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,834
I let Abel search for it,

318
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,690
but he didn't find anything.

319
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,309
He's just useless.

320
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:18,929
This is not an answer.

321
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,696
You're so stupid. Why would
I tell you the truth?

322
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,617
I don't know you.

323
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,343
If you want to get
information from anyone,

324
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:29,031
you have to open them up first.

325
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,724
This is common sense, you know.

326
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,610
No, no.

327
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,914
Now's not the time for this.

328
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,690
I need to get rid of that useless Abel.

329
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,893
Sorry, I don't have time for you.

330
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,368
Next, face the murderer and cannibal,

331
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,009
Jean-Pierre.

332
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,655
Crap.

333
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,819
That guy is probably as strong
as the Divine Visionary.

334
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,957
They might not be able
to compete with him.

335
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,814
Wow, wow, wow.

336
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,264
