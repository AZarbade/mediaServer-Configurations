00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,083
I'm just trying to push through.

185
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,835
[grunts]

186
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:59,673
-Are you Dalton Lambert?
-Yeah. Are you...?

187
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,175
Chris Winslow.

188
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:08,849
-Everything cool, fellas?
-Yeah, no, everything's fine.

189
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,476
I just-- I thought
my roommate would be a, um...

190
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,519
Um...

191
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,896
Uh, a guy.

192
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:14,813
[Dalton] Yeah.

193
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,398
Oh.

194
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:20,652
I just figured it's a liberal arts school,
and we mean "liberal."

195
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,322
Yeah, probably just confused
by the name "Chris."

196
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:27,075
Right. 'Cause that would never happen
with a name like "Dalton."

197
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,411
You know, I'm gonna go down
to the housing office

198
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,704
and get this all sorted out.

199
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:34,750
No, no, no.
Please, father of Dalton. Allow me.

200
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,544
I clearly interrupted some boy bonding.

201
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:39,213
I'll be back.

202
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,174
[Josh chuckles]

203
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,427
Hey. Uh...

204
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,222
I snagged this for you.

205
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,723
You should check it out.

206
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:53,268
If you hate it, no worries.
But you're not gonna hate it.

207
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,356
You really don't know me, do you?

208
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,067
I mean, you really think
I wanna join a frat?

209
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,986
It's just a party, Dalton.

210
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,363
Go. Have fun.

211
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,407
I mean, do it for me. I drove you here.

212
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,409
-You didn't even want to.
-Of course I did.

213
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:10,786
Stop lying to me!

214
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:14,414
I heard what Mom said at the funeral.

215
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,083
Well, I still did it.

216
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,126
Oh, so that makes you
father of the year now?

217
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,503
At least you've got a father.

218
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,505
Stop blaming your dad
for shit you screwed up.

219
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:24,466
He left like 40 years ago. Get over it.

220
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,468
God knows I'm not gonna be defined by you.

221
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:29,137
Are you kidding me?
After all we have done for you?

222
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:31,723
When did you become
this ungrateful, little shit?

223
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:36,395
No wonder Mom divorced you.

224
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,981
Thanks for the ride.

225
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,953
[poignant music playing]

226
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:08,385
[students chattering]

227
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,690
[engine starts]

228
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,450
[showers running]

229
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,536
[students chattering]

230
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,747
[melodica playing pop upbeat pop melody]

231
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,678
You can tell it's Shania Twain, right?

232
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:34,179
Yeah.

233
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,432
So, what'd they say at housing?

234
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:38,892
[Chris] They said, "Tough titties."

235
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,686
I got to sleep here tonight.

236
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,730
But I'll get a new room tomorrow,
so it's not a permanent thing.

237
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,107
Heartbreak, right?

238
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:49,653
-You're in the art school, I take it?
-Yeah. Are you music?

239
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:51,405
Math. I thought about music,

240
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,740
but the artist's life
is one of nomadic instability

241
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,200
and much gnashing of teeth.

242
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,121
But I'm sure you'll be super successful.

243
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:00,205
[chuckles]

244
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,333
-You wanna blow my hooter?
-What?

245
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:04,960
Do you play?

246
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:06,378
Oh. [chuckles]

247
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:09,715
-Uh, just a little piano.
-It's the same thing. Just blow.

248
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,429
My cooties are good cooties.

249
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,977
[playing cheerful melody]

250
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:29,776
What's that?

251
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,862
It's just something my mom wrote.

252
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,197
Sweet.

253
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:35,908
So...

254
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,577
what's some weird shit about you?

255
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:42,956
I don't know.

256
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,667
Uh... "I don't know."

257
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,128
Come on, man. Everybody's weird.

258
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,130
You first.

259
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:53,342
On Sundays, I wear a monocle
and I order takeout with a British accent.

260
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,927
That is weird.

261
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,345
Thank you.

262
00:20:56,428 --> 00:21:00,140
Okay, sometimes I eat instant oatmeal,

263
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:03,352
uh, with no, like,
water or milk or anything.

264
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,604
It's just kind of dry.

265
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,814
You're bad at this.

266
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,233
Let's try again.

267
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:11,235
When I was 10, my parents died,

268
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,028
and I went to go live
with my Grandma Perkee,

269
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:16,823
who once went almost nearly blind
from a gnarly case of athlete's foot.

270
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,161
I don't remember when I was 10.

271
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,248
Like, the whole year.

272
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:25,415
What do you mean?

273
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,502
I was in a coma.

274
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:30,295
Viral meningitis.

275
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:31,839
At least that's what they told me,

276
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:34,174
the few times
that they would talk about it.

277
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:37,678
But I don't remember anything.

278
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,471
I don't even remember being sick.

279
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:43,892
It's like I woke up one day
and a whole year had passed.

280
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,520
That's awful.

281
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,106
And pretty weird.

282
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:51,149
Well done.

283
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,403
Yeah, honestly, I wish I could have
forgotten a whole year when I was a kid.

284
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,823
Could've used a little "meningi-gi."

285
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,123
Uh... you know,
there is one more weird thing about me.

286
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:12,254
Um, ever since my coma,
I've been afraid of the dark.

287
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:16,091
I was afraid of Barbie dolls
till I was, like... now.

288
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,092
[Dalton chuckles]

289
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:18,886
There's nothing wrong with being scared.

290
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,722
Just as long as you don't keep me up
with some bright-ass night light.

291
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:23,348
[Dalton] Um...

292
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,437
-Seriously?
-Sorry.

293
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,272
Oh, man. Whatever.

294
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,608
It's fine. I'll deal.

295
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,328
[poignant, pensive music playing]

296
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,208
[on recording] Hey, this is Dalton.

297
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,667
I can't get to the phone right now,

298
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,836
so leave me a message
and I'll give you a call back.

299
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,047
-[answering machine beeps]
-[Josh] Hey, bud. It's me.

300
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,508
Just making sure
you're getting settled in okay.

301
00:22:57,591 --> 00:22:58,592
Um...

302
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:03,722
I was just, uh,
thinking about what you said...

303
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,058
and, um...

304
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:13,524
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on with me, but, um...

305
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,860
I'm gonna find out.

306
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,490
And I just wanted you to know that.

307
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:26,870
Okay, bye.

308
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:29,498
[students chattering]

309
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,934
[speaking indistinctly]

310
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:54,857
[Armagan] Hello.

311
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,109
I am Professor Armagan.

312
00:23:57,734 --> 00:23:59,611
Shut off your phones.

313
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:02,030
Open your portfolios.

314
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:04,700
Pull out something that will interest me.

315
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:09,121
Pin it to your easel.

316
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,498
Stand beside your work.

317
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:13,500
Stand proud.

318
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,011
Alec Anderson.

319
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,305
Your technique is obvious.

320
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:28,807
-It looks like a photograph.
-Thanks.

321
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,809
That wasn't a compliment.

322
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:34,229
Tear it up.

323
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:35,355
Excuse me?

324
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,399
The drawing. Tear it up.

325
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:40,736
[Alec] I worked my ass off on this piece.

326
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,446
No one will miss it.

327
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:45,866
No way.

328
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:50,162
Alas, our first casualty.

329
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:54,666
Usually, I go through introductions
before someone quits.

330
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,002
-I didn't quit.
-Yes, you did.

331
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,589
You just haven't realised it yet.
You can go.

332
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:12,726
Good luck.

333
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:18,482
Any fool can learn technique.

334
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:19,983
Even master it.

335
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:24,863
It doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't come from inside.

336
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:29,993
I am not interested in the "rules of art."

337
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:32,329
We are going to break the rules.

338
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,542
Then I want you to break them again.

339
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,544
See how broken you can get.

340
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,921
[students gasp]

341
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:48,929
Dalton Lambert.

342
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:50,430
Yes, ma'am?

343
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:54,643
Why in the hell would you destroy
a beautiful drawing like that?

344
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,694
Once more for good measure?

345
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,782
Wasn't so hard, was it?

346
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,746
Good. You must let go of your past.

347
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,958
Shed your skin in order to grow.

348
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,252
I'll count backwards from ten.

349
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:22,004
With each number,

350
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:27,801
I want you to sink
further and further into yourself.

351
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:31,638
Do not lift the charcoal from the paper.

352
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:33,682
Ten...

353
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,726
nine...

354
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,148
eight, seven, six...

355
00:26:41,857 --> 00:26:43,066
five...

356
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:48,572
four, three, two...

357
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:50,782
one.

358
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:53,327
[ominous music playing]

359
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,330
Draw whatever your soul brings forth.

360
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,832
An experience that defines you.

361
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,754

01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:37,763
So I'm here to talk to you
about astral projection...

722
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:40,807
and The Further.

723
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,100
Okay...

724
01:02:43,477 --> 01:02:44,811
give me a minute here.

725
01:02:45,938 --> 01:02:46,939
Three...

726
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:48,982
two...

727
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:51,735
one.

728
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:54,780
The Further...

729
01:02:56,657 --> 01:02:58,575
is a dark realm...

730
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:01,578
filled with tortured souls of the dead...

731
01:03:02,663 --> 01:03:06,375
and some are doomed...

732
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:10,128
to live the worst mistakes of their lives

733
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,006
over and over and over for all eternity.

734
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,884
When you astral project...

735
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,303
or you travel to this realm...

736
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:20,556
these are the souls...

737
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:23,225
that you awaken with your presence.

738
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:25,269
They can smell you.

739
01:03:26,144 --> 01:03:28,730
The presence of life.

740
01:03:30,232 --> 01:03:32,192
Life is what they crave,

741
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:33,902
more than anything.

742
01:03:33,986 --> 01:03:36,572
So the further you travel...

743
01:03:36,655 --> 01:03:38,574
[unsettling music playing]

744
01:03:38,657 --> 01:03:40,701
the riskier the journey becomes.

745
01:03:41,368 --> 01:03:45,622
They want life, and they can come
to our world to get it.

746
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:49,042
Keep a steady stride.

747
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:52,087
[mouse clicks]

748
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,135
[groans] I see those gears turning.
What is it?

749
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:02,347
-That kid from the frat house?
-The pukey kid?

750
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:04,558
Yeah. He said something to me.

751
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:07,561
He said, "Close the door."

752
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:09,813
I'm sure he did.
It probably wasn't his proudest moment.

753
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,234
Yeah, but what if
he meant something else?

754
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,986
What if he was talking about this door?

755
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,072
So, what? You want to go back and ask him?

756
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:22,868
Seriously?

757
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:24,203
I need to know.

758
01:04:24,286 --> 01:04:26,538
Look, I feel bad for the dude, I do,

759
01:04:26,622 --> 01:04:30,792
but dark realms are typically
places I try to avoid.

760
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,922
There's something important

761
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,423
about this painting, Chris.

762
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,010
I have to find out.

763
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:42,095
Okay.

764
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:47,809
It's not like Nick the Dick is just gonna
let you waltz into his bedroom

765
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:49,520
and chat with the ghost in his toilet.

766
01:04:50,771 --> 01:04:51,855
He'll never know I'm there.

767
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:56,568
[students laughing and chattering]

768
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:06,370
So, what's the plan?

769
01:05:06,453 --> 01:05:07,955
-I got this.
-[woman] Can I help you?

770
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,126
[in British accent] Hello.

771
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,588
I have left my brassiere
in Nicholas's room,

772
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:19,007
and I was wondering
if he is perchance home?

773
01:05:19,925 --> 01:05:22,803
I think he's upstairs studying with Paige.

774
01:05:24,763 --> 01:05:26,390
[Chris in normal voice]
Great job, Dolphin.

775
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:31,103
I'm gonna read you this.
It's called In Flames.

776
01:05:31,186 --> 01:05:34,898
Very vulnerable piece.
"Looking across a campfire..."

777
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:41,446
I need a room with darkness.

778
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:42,531
Okay.

779
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:47,202
Then what?

780
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:51,665
You gonna float through the air
and do a little "Ooh"?

781
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,293
I'm not like a ghost.

782
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:56,920
And you never will be
with that attitude, Casper.

783
01:05:59,047 --> 01:05:59,882
Bingo.

784
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:07,222
What are the chances
those bedsheets are crusty?

785
01:06:07,306 --> 01:06:09,224
Probably snap like a taco shell.

786
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,101
I'll take the dirty floor.

787
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:17,691
[Chris] Okay...

788
01:06:25,532 --> 01:06:28,410
-Can you give me a little space, please?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

789
01:06:38,003 --> 01:06:39,004
Okay, you ready?

790
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:45,219
-[ominous music playing]
-Ten, nine...

791
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:48,180
eight, seven...

792
01:06:49,097 --> 01:06:51,642
six, five...

793
01:06:52,893 --> 01:06:55,437
four, three...

794
01:06:56,438 --> 01:06:59,316
two, one.

795
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,831
Are you floating yet?

796
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:20,837
[door opens]

797
01:07:22,923 --> 01:07:25,133
[hinges groan]

798
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:28,637
Farewell, traveller.

799
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,723
[unsettling, pensive music playing]

800
01:07:40,274 --> 01:07:41,525
[whispers] You out here, Dalton?

801
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,551
[Nick] ...creative writing double major.

802
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:12,890
But I'm also crazy good at finance,
so I don't want to waste that gift.

803
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:15,601
How long do you have to keep that on?

804
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:17,560
Oh.

805
01:08:18,812 --> 01:08:19,813
Yeah, it's good now.

806
01:08:21,523 --> 01:08:22,815
My pores are good.

807
01:08:43,127 --> 01:08:44,129
[Nick] Oh.

808
01:08:52,804 --> 01:08:55,390
-[stomach gurgles]
-[groans]

809
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:01,688
I'm gonna be a while.

810
01:09:02,397 --> 01:09:03,690
Gross.

811
01:09:18,205 --> 01:09:19,038
Dalton?

812
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,583
Dalton.

813
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:27,631
Someone turn on the lights!

814
01:09:34,721 --> 01:09:35,556
[Chris] Dalton.

815
01:09:36,223 --> 01:09:37,224
Dalton.

816
01:09:40,185 --> 01:09:41,144
Dalton, wake up.

817
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:42,270
-[Nick] Guys! Seriously.
-Chris.

818
01:09:42,354 --> 01:09:44,565
[Nick] Guys, who's messing with me?

819
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,065
[sick kid] Close the door!

820
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:48,068
-Close the door!
-[yells]

821
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:50,444
Dalton?

822
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:53,323
-[intense music playing]
-[choking]

823
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:02,249
-[sick kid] Close the door!
-Chris!

824
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:20,893
Oh, God.

825
01:10:20,976 --> 01:10:22,311
[snarls]

826
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:30,110
Come on!

827
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,237
[gasping]

828
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:34,907
[gasping]

829
01:10:37,993 --> 01:10:38,994
[Dalton] Chris.

830
01:10:40,662 --> 01:10:41,788
What...?

831
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,503
[ominous music playing]

832
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:50,631
[microfilm viewer clinking and clanking]

833
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:07,523
Come on.

834
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:33,090
What?

835
01:11:58,574 --> 01:11:59,575
[Dalton] Chris.

836
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:02,494
-Chris. Hey. I didn't mean it like that...
-Don't.

837
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:06,999
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

838
01:12:07,082 --> 01:12:08,250
I'm okay.

839
01:12:09,293 --> 01:12:13,005
I'm sorry. I didn't know
anyone could get hurt in the real world.

840
01:12:13,088 --> 01:12:15,007
Well, they can.

841
01:12:16,925 --> 01:12:19,052
You have no idea what you're messing with.

842
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:22,222
I can't be a part of this, Dalton.

843
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:25,475
And neither should you.
Because next time, you might not wake up.

844
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:27,477
[ominous music playing]

845
01:12:45,537 --> 01:12:46,538
[knocking on door]

846
01:12:51,084 --> 01:12:52,461
-Hey.
-Hi.

847
01:12:52,544 --> 01:12:55,547
Uh, it's not your weekend.
Kali's at a sleepover and Foster's...

848
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,216
I'm not here for the kids.

849
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,384
Can we talk?

850
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:01,845
Sure.

851
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:07,935
[line dialling]

852
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,980
[Foster] Wow, two calls in one week.

853
01:13:12,064 --> 01:13:14,316
-[Dalton] Come on, man.
-Haven't you made any friends yet?

854
01:13:16,193 --> 01:13:18,779
Tell me everything you remember
about my coma.

855
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,574
You should talk to Mom.

856
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,034
I think these...

857
01:13:24,952 --> 01:13:27,538
-things I'm drawing, they...
-The door?

858
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:29,873
And now a guy with a hammer.

859
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:36,213
-A hammer?
-I think they could be clues from my past,

860
01:13:36,296 --> 01:13:38,590
thoughts that have disappeared
'cause of my coma.

861
01:13:38,674 --> 01:13:42,261
-I don't know why they're coming out now--
-Wait. Dalton.

862
01:13:44,429 --> 01:13:45,430
What is it?

863
01:13:46,557 --> 01:13:48,559
I've had this image in my mind for years.

864
01:13:49,476 --> 01:13:53,564
Mom always says it's not real.
It's just a bad dream. But...

865
01:13:53,647 --> 01:13:56,358
Tell me, little brother. Come on.

866
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:03,740
Okay. We're in a room somewhere.
Like a basement.

867
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:06,326
You remember that?

868
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,703
[crying]

869
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:11,957
Dalton, you there?

870
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,502
[tense, unsettling music playing]

871
01:15:22,402 --> 01:15:24,947
All I ever wanted
was to be better than my father.

872
01:15:25,697 --> 01:15:28,742
You know that. Just to be a good dad.

873
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:31,495
You were. You are, Josh.

874
01:15:31,578 --> 01:15:33,038
Well, Dalton would disagree.

875
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:37,042
Well, if it's any consolation,
I can't even get him to call me back.

876
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:43,048
My dad abandoned his family, and...

877
01:15:43,757 --> 01:15:45,175
I've done the same thing.

878
01:15:45,259 --> 01:15:46,552
No, you haven't.

879
01:15:46,635 --> 01:15:50,138
You're not him, Josh,
and you're allowed to be angry at him.

880
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:52,307
I am angry.
I've been angry for a long time.

881
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:54,142
Angry at a man that I have never met.

882
01:15:55,686 --> 01:15:59,690
Angry at a man that jumped off the roof
of a mental hospital in 1978.

883
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:05,779
For more than 40 years,
that man has been dead and gone.

884
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:07,489
My dad.

885
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:09,199
Ben Burton.

886
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,540
So how in the hell is he terrorizing me
here, now, in the real world?

887
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:19,126
-He attacked me at Mom's place...
-He attacked you?

888
01:16:19,209 --> 01:16:22,504
Yeah. So am I just crazy, or...?

889
01:16:23,839 --> 01:16:26,466
I don't know. He, uh...

890
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:32,681
left this for my mom the day he died.

891
01:16:35,934 --> 01:16:37,853
What ends with him?

892
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,108
-Josh...
-Is that the answer? Am I just crazy?

893
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:45,527
Is his madness inside of me?

894
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:49,323
Is that why I've been so lost
the past few years?

895
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:52,618
Did I pass this curse on to our kids?
Is he gonna haunt them...

896
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:53,994
-Josh, Josh.
-...like he haunted me?

897
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:55,829
Why didn't my mother say
anything about this?

898
01:16:55,913 --> 01:16:56,747
